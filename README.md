# Python Client-Server App
Python 2.7 implementation of client-server communication using TCP/IP sockets &amp; TKinter

## How it works

Client writes messages to Server. Server receives a message and send it back with appended text "from server".

Application runs on localhost. After disconnecting the client, server displays a message.
